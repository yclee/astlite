	  ........ r115564 | russell | 2008-05-08 14:14:04 -0500 (Thu, 08
	  May 2008) | 25 lines Fix a race condition that bbryant just found
	  while doing some IAX2 testing. He was running Asterisk trunk
	  running IAX2 calls through a few Asterisk boxes, however, the
	  audio was extremely choppy. We looked at a packet trace and saw a
	  storm of INVAL and VNAK frames being sent from one box to
	  another. It turned out that what had happened was that one box
	  tried to send a CONTROL frame before the 3 way handshake had
	  completed. So, that frame did not include the destination call
	  number, because it didn't have it yet. Part of our recent work
	  for security issues included an additional check to ensure that
	  frames that are supposed to include the destination call number
	  have the correct one. This caused the frame to be rejected with
	  an INVAL. The frame would get retransmitted for forever, rejected
	  every time ... This race condition exists in all versions that
	  got the security changes, in theory. However, it is really only
	  likely that this would cause a problem in Asterisk trunk. There
	  was a control frame being sent (SRCUPDATE) at the _very_
	  beginning of the call, which does not exist in 1.2 or 1.4.
	  However, I am fixing all versions that could potentially be
	  affected by the introduced race condition. These changes are what
	  bbryant and I came up with to fix the issue. Instead of simply
	  dropping control frames that get sent before the handshake is
	  complete, the code attempts to wait a little while, since in most
	  cases, the handshake will complete very quickly. If it doesn't
	  complete after yielding for a little while, then the frame gets
	  dropped. ........

	* channels/chan_iax2.c:
	  Merge changes from team/russell/iax2_find_callno and
	  iax2_find_callno_1.4 These changes address a critical performance
	  issue introduced in the latest release. The fix for the latest
	  security issue included a change that made Asterisk randomly
	  choose call numbers to make them more difficult to guess by
	  attackers. However, due to some inefficient (this is by far, an
	  understatement) code, when Asterisk chose high call numbers,
	  chan_iax2 became unusable after just a small number of calls. On
	  a small embedded platform, it would not be able to handle a
	  single call. On my Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.33 GHz, I couldn't run
	  more than about 16 IAX2 channels. Ouch. These changes address
	  some performance issues of the find_callno() function that have
	  bothered me for a very long time. On every incoming media frame,
	  it iterated through every possible call number trying to find a
	  matching active call. This involved a mutex lock and unlock for
	  each call number checked. So, if the random call number chosen
	  was 20000, then every media frame would cause 20000 locks and
	  unlocks. Previously, this problem was not as obvious since
	  Asterisk always chose the lowest call number it could. A second
	  container for IAX2 pvt structs has been added. It is an astobj2
	  hash table. When we know the remote side's call number, the pvt
	  goes into the hash table with a hash value of the remote side's
	  call number. Then, lookups for incoming media frames are a very
	  fast hash lookup instead of an absolutely insane array traversal.
	  In a quick test, I was able to get more than 3600% more IAX2
	  channels on my machine with these changes.

	* apps/app_playback.c, main/pbx.c: These small documentation
	  updates made in response to a query in asterisk-users, where a
	  user was using Playback, but needed the features of Background,
	  and had no idea that Background existed, or that it might provide
	  the features he needed. I thought the best way to avert these
	  kinds of queries was to provide "See Also" references in all
	  three of "Background", "Playback", "WaitExten". Perhaps a project
	  to do this with all related apps is in order.

	* pbx/pbx_ael.c, include/asterisk/ael_structs.h: (closes issue
	  #12302) Reported by: pj Tested by: murf These changes will set a
	  channel variable ~~EXTEN~~ just before generating code for a
	  switch, with the value of ${EXTEN}. The exten is marked as having
	  a switch, and ever after that, till the end of the exten, we
	  substitute any ${EXTEN} with ${~~EXTEN~~} instead in application
	  arguments; (and the ${EXTEN: also). The reason for this, is that
	  because switches are coded using separate extensions to provide
	  pattern matching, and jumping to/from these switch extensions
	  messes up the ${EXTEN} value, which blows the minds of users.

	* main/frame.c: Remove excessive smoother optimization that was
	  causing audio glitches (small "pops") after (about 200ms later)
	  an "incorrectly" sized frame was received. While it would be very
	  nice to keep this as optimized as possible, it makes no sense for
	  the smoother to be dropping random bits of audio like this. Isn't
	  that the whole point of a smoother? Closes issue #12093.

	  main/app.c: Add an option (transmit_silence) which transmits

	* channels/chan_sip.c: This is a revert for revision 108288. The
	  reason is that that revision was not for an actual bug fix per
	  se, and so it really should not have been in 1.4 in the first
	  place. Plus, people who compile with DO_CRASH are more likely to
	  encounter a crash due to this change. While I think the usage of
	  DO_CRASH in ast_sched_del is a bit absurd, this sort of change is
	  beyond the scope of 1.4 and should be done instead in a developer
	  branch based on trunk so that all scheduler functions are fixed
	  at once. I also am reverting the change to trunk and 1.6 since
	  they also suffer from the DO_CRASH potential. (closes issue

	* main/autoservice.c: Shorten the ast_waitfor() timeout from 500 ms
	  to 50 ms in the autoservice thread. This really should not make a
	  difference except in very rare cases. That case would be that all
	  of the channels in autoservice are not generating any frames. In
	  that case, this change reduces the potential amount of time that
	  a thread waits in ast_autoservice_stop() for the autoservice
	  thread to wrap back around to the beginning of its loop. (closes

	* main/config.c: (closes issue #11442) Reported by: tzafrir
	  Patches: 11442.patch uploaded by murf (license 17) Tested by:
	  murf I didn't give tzafrir very much time to test this, but if he
	  does still have remaining issues, he is welcome to re-open this
	  bug, and we'll do what is called for. I reproduced the problem,
	  and tested the fix, so I hope I am not jumping by just going
	  ahead and committing the fix. The problem was with what file_save
	  does with templates; firstly, it tended to print out multiple
	  options: [my_category](!)(templateref) instead of
	  [my_category](!,templateref) which is fixed by this patch.
	  Nextly, the code to suppress output of duplicate declarations
	  that would occur because the reader copies inherited declarations
	  down the hierarchy, was not working. Thus: [master-template](!)
	  mastervar = bar [template](!,master-template) tvar = value
	  [cat](template) catvar = val would be rewritten as: ;! ;!
	  Automatically generated configuration file ;! Filename:
	  experiment.conf (/etc/asterisk/experiment.conf) ;! Generator:
	  Manager ;! Creation Date: Tue Mar 18 23:17:46 2008 ;!
	  [master-template](!) mastervar = bar
	  [template](!,master-template) mastervar = bar tvar = value
	  [cat](template) mastervar = bar tvar = value catvar = val This
	  has been fixed. Since the config reader 'explodes' inherited vars
	  into the category, users may, in certain circumstances, see
	  output different from what they originally entered, but it should
	  be both correct and equivalent.

	* main/utils.c: Fix a logic flaw in the code that stores lock info
	  which is displayed via the "core show locks" command. The idea
	  behind this section of code was to remove the previous lock from
	  the list if it was a trylock that had failed. Unfortunately,
	  instead of checking the status of the previous lock, we were
	  referencing the index immediately following the previous lock in
	  the lock_info->locks array. The result of this problem, under the
	  right circumstances, was that the lock which we currently in the
	  process of attempting to acquire could "overwrite" the previous
	  lock which was acquired. While this does not in any way affect
	  typical operation, it *could* lead to misleading "core show
	  locks" output.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix a race condition in the SIP packet
	  scheduler which could cause a crash. chan_sip uses the scheduler
	  API in order to schedule retransmission of reliable packets (such
	  as INVITES). If a retransmission of a packet is occurring, then
	  the packet is removed from the scheduler and retrans_pkt is
	  called. Meanwhile, if a response is received from the packet as
	  previously transmitted, then when we ACK the response, we will
	  remove the packet from the scheduler and free the packet. The
	  problem is that both the ACK function and retrans_pkt attempt to
	  acquire the same lock at the beginning of the function call. This
	  means that if the ACK function acquires the lock first, then it
	  will free the packet which retrans_pkt is about to read from and
	  write to. The result is a crash. The solution: 1. If the ACK
	  function fails to remove the packet from the scheduler and the
	  retransmit id of the packet is not -1 (meaning that we have not
	  reached the maximum number of retransmissions) then release the
	  lock and yield so that retrans_pkt may acquire the lock and
	  operate. 2. Make absolutely certain that the ACK function does
	  not recursively lock the lock in question. If it does, then
	  releasing the lock will do no good, since retrans_pkt will still
	  be unable to acquire the lock. (closes issue #12098) Reported by:

	* apps/app_chanspy.c, main/channel.c, include/asterisk/channel.h:
	  Fix another issue that was causing crashes in chanspy. This
	  introduces a new datastore callback, called chan_fixup(). The
	  concept is exactly like the fixup callback that is used in the
	  channel technology interface. This callback gets called when the
	  owning channel changes due to a masquerade. Before this was
	  introduced, if a masquerade happened on a channel being spyed on,

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Change AST_SCHED_DEL use to ast_sched_del
	  for autocongestion in chan_sip. The scheduler callback will
	  always return 0. This means that this id is never rescheduled, so
	  it makes no sense to loop trying to delete the id from the
	  scheduler queue. If we fail to remove the item from the queue
	  once, it will fail every single time. (Yes I realize that in this
	  case, the macro would exit early because the id is set to -1 in
	  the callback, but it still makes no sense to use that macro in
	  favor of calling ast_sched_del once and being done with it) This
	  is the first of potentially several such fixes.

	* include/asterisk/sched.h: Added a large comment before the
	  AST_SCHED_DEL macro to explain its purpose as well as when it is
	  appropriate and when it is not appropriate to use it. I also
	  removed the part of the debug message that mentions that this is
	  probably a bug because there are some perfectly legitimate places
	  where ast_sched_del may fail to delete an entry (e.g. when the
	  scheduler callback manually reschedules with a new id instead of
	  returning non-zero to tell the scheduler to reschedule with the
	  same idea). I also raised the debug level of the debug message in
	  AST_SCHED_DEL since it seems like it could come up quite
	  frequently since the macro is probably being used in several
	  places where it shouldn't be. Also removed the redundant line,
	  file, and function information since that is provided by ast_log.

2008-03-12 19:57 +0000 [r108135]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* apps/app_chanspy.c, main/channel.c: (closes issue #12187,
	  reported by atis, fixed by me after some brainstorming on the
	  issue with mmichelson) - Update copyright info on app_chanspy. -
	  Fix a race condition that caused app_chanspy to crash. The issue
	  was that the chanspy datastore magic that was used to ensure that
	  spyee channels did not disappear out from under the code did not
	  completely solve the problem. It was actually possible for
	  chanspy to acquire a channel reference out of its datastore to a
	  channel that was in the middle of being destroyed. That was
	  because datastore destruction in ast_channel_free() was done near
	  the end. So, this left the code in app_chanspy accessing a
	  channel that was partially, or completely invalid because it was
	  in the process of being free'd by another thread. The following
	  sort of shows the code path where the race occurred:
	  =============================================================================
	  Thread 1 (PBX thread for spyee chan) || Thread 2 (chanspy)
	  --------------------------------------||-------------------------------------
	  ast_channel_free() || - remove channel from channel list || -
	  lock/unlock the channel to ensure || that no references retrieved
	  from || the channel list exist. ||

	  overflow, and gcc-4.3's improved optimizer tries to take
	  advantage of handling potential overflow conditions at compile
	  time; for now, suppress these optimizations until we can fiure
	  out if the code needs improvement - main/udptl.c has some

	* main/asterisk.c, main/channel.c, include/asterisk.h,
	  main/autoservice.c: Merge in some changes from
	  team/russell/autoservice-nochans-1.4 These changes fix up some
	  dubious code that I came across while auditing what happens in
	  the autoservice thread when there are no channels currently in
	  autoservice. 1) Change it so that autoservice thread doesn't keep
	  looping around calling ast_waitfor_n() on 0 channels twice a
	  second. Instead, use a thread condition so that the thread
	  properly goes to sleep and does not wake up until a channel is
	  put into autoservice. This actually fixes an interesting bug, as
	  well. If the autoservice thread is already running (almost always
	  is the case), then when the thread goes from having 0 channels to
	  have 1 channel to autoservice, that channel would have to wait
	  for up to 1/2 of a second to have the first frame read from it.
	  2) Fix up the code in ast_waitfor_nandfds() for when it gets
	  called with no channels and no fds to poll() on, such as was the
	  case with the previous code for the autoservice thread. In this
	  case, the code would call alloca(0), and pass the result as the
	  first argument to poll(). In this case, the 2nd argument to
	  poll() specified that there were no fds, so this invalid pointer
	  shouldn't actually get dereferenced, but, this code makes it
	  explicit and ensures the pointers are NULL unless we have valid
	  data to put there. (related to issue #12116)

	* include/asterisk/smdi.h, apps/app_voicemail.c,
	  channels/chan_zap.c, res/res_smdi.c, configs/smdi.conf.sample:
	  Merge changes from team/russell/smdi-1.4 This commit brings in a
	  significant set of changes to the SMDI support in Asterisk. There
	  were a number of bugs in the current implementation, most notably
	  being that it was very likely on busy systems to pop off the
	  wrong message from the SMDI message queue. So, this set of
	  changes fixes the issues discovered as well as introducing some
	  new ways to use the SMDI support which are required to avoid the
	  bugs with grabbing the wrong message off of the queue. This code
	  introduces a new interface to SMDI, with two dialplan functions.
	  First, you get an SMDI message in the dialplan using
	  SMDI_MSG_RETRIEVE() and then you access details in the message
	  using the SMDI_MSG() function. A side benefit of this is that it
	  now supports more than just chan_zap. For example, with this
	  implementation, you can have some FXO lines being terminated on a
	  SIP gateway, but the SMDI link in Asterisk. Another issue with
	  the current implementation is that it is quite common that the
	  station ID that comes in on the SMDI link is not necessarily the
	  same as the Asterisk voicemail box. There are now additional
	  directives in the smdi.conf configuration file which let you map
	  SMDI station IDs to Asterisk voicemail boxes. Yet another issue
	  with the current SMDI support was related to MWI reporting over
	  the SMDI link. The current code could only report a MWI change
	  when the change was made by someone calling into voicemail. If
	  the change was made by some other entity (such as with IMAP
	  storage, or with a web interface of some kind), then the MWI
	  change would never be sent. The SMDI module can now poll for MWI
	  changes if configured to do so. This work was inspired by and
	  primarily done for the University of Pennsylvania. (also related
	  to issue #9260)

	* apps/app_chanspy.c: This patch fixes some pretty significant
	  problems with how app_chanspy handles pointers to channels that
	  are being spied upon. It was very likely that a crash would occur
	  if the channel being spied upon hung up. This was because the
	  current ast_channel handling _requires_ that the object is locked
	  or else it could disappear at any time (except in the owning
	  channel thread). So, this patch uses some channel datastore magic
	  on the spied upon channel to be able to detect if and when the
	  channel goes away. (closes issue #11877) (patch written by me,
	  but thanks to kpfleming for the idea, and to file for review)

	* main/utils.c: Improve the lock tracking code a bit so that a
	  bunch of old locks that threads failed to lock don't sit around
	  in the history. When a lock is first locked, this checks to see
	  if the last lock in the list was one that was failed to be
	  locked. If it is, then that was a lock that we're no longer
	  sitting in a trylock loop trying to lock, so just remove it.

	* doc/imapstorage.txt, configure, configure.ac: Final round of
	  changes for configure script logic for IMAP Now if a directory is
	  specified, then we will search that directory for a source
	  installation of the IMAP toolkit. If none is found, then we will
	  use that directory as the basis for detecting a package
	  installation of the IMAP c-client. If that check fails, then
	  configure will fail.

	* configure, configure.ac: Fix a bit of wrong logic in the
	  configure script that caused problems when trying to configure
	  without IMAP. Patch suggestion from phsultan, but I modified it
	  slightly. (closes issue #12003) Reported by: pj Tested by:
	  putnopvut

	* doc/imapstorage.txt, configure, configure.ac: I apparently
	  misunderstood one of the requirements of this configure change.
	  Now, if a source directory is specified with the --with-imap
	  option, and a valid source installation is not detected there,
	  then configure will fail and will not check for a package
	  installation.

	* doc/imapstorage.txt: Make a small clarification in the
	  documentation

	* doc/imapstorage.txt: Update documentation regarding configuration
	  of IMAP

	* apps/app_voicemail.c, configure,
	  include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac: Change to the
	  configure logic regarding IMAP. Prior to this commit, if you
	  wished to configure Asterisk with IMAP support, you would use the
	  --with-imap configure switch in one of the following two ways:
	  --with-imap=/some/directory would look in the directory specified
	  for a UW IMAP source installation --with-imap would assume that
	  you had imap-2004g installed in .. relative to the Asterisk
	  source With this set of changes the two above options still work
	  the same, but there are two new behaviors, too.
	  --with-imap=system will assume that you have -libc-client.so
	  where you store your shared objects and will attempt to find
	  c-client headers in your include path either in the imap or
	  c-client directory. If either of the two original methods of
	  specifying the imap option should fail, then the check for
	  --with-imap =system will be performed in addition. It is only
	  after this "system" check that failure can happen.

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Fix build for non-IMAP builds

	* channels/chan_local.c: Fixing an issue wherein monitoring local
	  channels was not possible. During a channel masquerade, the
	  monitors on the two channels involved are swapped. In 99% of the
	  cases this results in the desired effect. However, if monitoring
	  a local channel, this caused the monitor which was on the local
	  channel to get moved onto a channel which is immediately hung up
	  after the masquerade has completed. By swapping the monitors
	  prior to the masquerade, we avoid the problem by tricking the
	  masquerade into placing the monitor back onto the channel where
	  we want it. During the investigation of the issue, the channel's
	  monitor was the only thing that was swapped in such a manner
	  which did not make sense to have done. All other variable
	  swapping made sense.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Change a buffer in check_auth() to be a
	  thread local dynamically allocated buffer, instead of a massive
	  buffer on the stack. This fixes a crash reported by Qwell due to
	  running out of stack space when building with LOW_MEMORY defined.
	  On a very related note, the usage of BUFSIZ in various places in
	  chan_sip is arbitrary and careless. BUFSIZ is a system specific
	  define. On my machine, it is 8192, but by definition (according
	  to google) could be as small as 256. So, this buffer in
	  check_auth was 16 kB. We don't even support SIP messages larger
	  than 4 kB! Further usage of this define should be avoided, unless
	  it is used in the proper context.

	* main/rtp.c, include/asterisk/translate.h, main/frame.c,
	  main/translate.c, main/abstract_jb.c, channels/chan_iax2.c,
	  codecs/codec_zap.c, include/asterisk/frame.h: Commit a fix for
	  some memory access errors pointed out by the valgrind2.txt output
	  on issue #11698. The issue here is that it is possible for an
	  instance of a translator to get destroyed while the frame
	  allocated as a part of the translator is still being processed.
	  Specifically, this is possible anywhere between a call to
	  ast_read() and ast_frame_free(), which is _a lot_ of places in
	  the code. The reason this happens is that the channel might get
	  masqueraded during this time. During a masquerade, existing
	  translation paths get destroyed. So, this patch fixes the issue
	  in an API and ABI compatible way. (This one is for you,
	  paravoid!) It changes an int in ast_frame to be used as flag
	  bits. The 1 bit is still used to indicate that the frame contains
	  timing information. Also, a second flag has been added to
	  indicate that the frame came from a translator. When a frame with
	  this flag gets released and has this flag, a function is called
	  in translate.c to let it know that this frame is doing being
	  processed. At this point, the flag gets cleared. Also, if the
	  translator was requested to be destroyed while its internal frame
	  still had this flag set, its destruction has been deffered until
	  it finds out that the frame is no longer being processed.
	  Admittedly, this feels like a hack. But, it does fix the issue,
	  and I was not able to think of a better solution ...

	  include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, main/Makefile, configure.ac,
	  makeopts.in: Backport the ability to set the ToS bits on Linux
	  when not running as root. Normally, we would not backport
	  features into 1.4, but, I was convinced by the justification
	  supplied by the supplier of this patch. He pointed out that this
	  patch removes a requirement for running as root, thus reducing
	  the potential impacts of security issues. (closes issue #11742)

	* apps/app_followme.c: Ensure the return value of ast_bridge_call

2008-01-11 03:39 +0000 [r97976-98082]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* main/frame.c: Fix samples vs. length calculations for g722

	* main/translate.c: Simplify this code with a suggestion from Luigi
	  on the asterisk-dev list. Instead of using is16kHz(), implement a
	  format_rate() function.

	* main/translate.c: Fix various timing calculations that made
	  assumptions that the audio being processed was at a sample rate
	  of 8 kHz.

2008-01-10 23:08 +0000 [r97973]  Tilghman Lesher <tlesher@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c, main/translate.c: 1) When we get a
	  translated frame out, clone it, because if the translator pvt is
	  freed before we use the frame, bad things happen. 2) Getting a
	  failure from ast_sched_delete means that the schedule ID is
	  currently running. Don't just ignore it. (Closes issue #11698)

	* pbx/ael/ael_lex.c, pbx/Makefile, pbx/ael/ael.flex: Applied the
	  same fixes for ael.flex as was done in 97849 for ast_expr2.fl;
	  overrode the normally generate yyfree func with our own version
	  that checks the pointer for non-null before passing to free().
	  Also takes care of a little problem with 2.5.33 and the use of
	  the __STDC_VERSION__ macro.

	* main/ast_expr2.fl, main/Makefile, main/ast_expr2f.c: This is a
	  fix for 2 things: a problem Terry was having in OSX with null
	  pointers, which was my fault, as I probably forgot to run the sed
	  script last time I made mods. So, I moved the fix into the flex
	  input itself. Then, I found when I used flex 2.5.33, that it was
	  using __STDC_VERSION__, and that's not real good; so I added back
	  in a DIFFERENT sed script to fix that little mess. Tested
	  everything, a couple different ways. Hope I did no harm, at the
	  least.

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: make sure frame is completely clean,
	  before we send it to asterisk as DTMF. If we don't make it clean,
	  it happens that one way audio occurs..

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: when overlapdial was used and no number

	* apps/app_queue.c: A change to improve the accuracy of queue
	  logging in the case where a member does not answer during the
	  specified timeout period. Prior to this change, there was a small
	  chance that the member name recorded in this case would be blank.
	  Also prior to this change, if using the ringall strategy, if no
	  one answered the call during the specified timeout, the member
	  name listed in the queue log would randomly be one of the members
	  that was rung. (closes issue #11498, reported and tested by

2007-12-31 23:43 +0000 [r95577]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* main/pbx.c: Avoiding a potentially bad locking situation.
	  ast_merge_contexts_and_delete writelocks the conlock, then calls
	  ast_hint_extension, which attempts to readlock the same lock.
	  Recursion with read-write locks is dangerous, so the inner lock
	  needs to be removed. I did this by copying the "guts" of
	  ast_hint_extension into ast_merge_contexts_and_delete (sans the
	  extra lock). (this change is inspired by the locking problems
	  seen in issue #11080, but I have no idea if this is the
	  problematic area experienced by the reporters of that issue)

2007-12-28 00:16 +0000 [r95095]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: I found a bug while browsing the queue code and
	  managed to reproduce it in a small setup. If a queue uses the
	  ringall strategy, it was possible through unfortunate coincidence
	  for a single member at a given penalty level to make app_queue
	  think that all members at that penalty level were unavailable and
	  cause the members at the next penalty level to be rung. With this
	  patch, we will only move to the next penalty level if ALL the
	  members at a given penalty level are unreachable.

	* main/pbx.c: Now that the contexts lock is a read/write lock, it

	  was already set before starting autoservice, remember it and
	  ensure that the channel has the same setting when autoservice
	  gets stopped. (pointed out by d1mas, patched up by me)

	* main/autoservice.c: When a channel is in autoservice, mark a flag
	  on the channel that says that we only care about the END of a
	  digit. That way, no magic digit emulation stuff will happen when
	  all we're doing is queueing up END frames.

	* main/autoservice.c: Don't store DTMF BEGIN frames while a channel
	  is in autoservice. It's just going to make ast_read() do a lot of
	  extra work when the channel comes back out of autoservice.
	  (closes issue #11628, patched by me)

	* Makefile: List include/asterisk/version.h as a .PHONY target
	  because we want the commands listed for this target to be
	  executed regardless of whether the file exists or not. This fixes
	  having the version not up to date when running from svn. (closes

	* main/channel.c: Race: we need to wait to queue a NewChannel event
	  until after the channel is inserted into the channel list. The

	  http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2007-December/031145.html,
	  rizzo brought up some issues related to the way that the metadata
	  required for menuselect and the rest of the build system is
	  extracted from the source files. Since I had a few hours to kill
	  on an airplane today, I decided to improve this situation... so
	  now the system caches the extracted metadata and uses it to build
	  the menuselect 'tree' as much as it can. The result of this is
	  that when a single source file is changed, only the metadata for
	  that file needs to be extracted again, and the rest is used from
	  the cache files. I also reduced the number of forked processes
	  required to do the metadata extraction; it was actually possible
	  to do most of what we needed in the Makefiles themselves without
	  using any shell scripts at all! On my laptop, these changes
	  resulted in an 80% decrease in the time required for the
	  'menuselect.makeopts' automatic check to occur after editing a
	  single source file. While doing this work I also cleaned up a few
	  minor things in the Makefiles, adding a check for 'awk' to the
	  configure script and changed all remaining places we use 'grep'
	  or 'awk' to use the ones found by the configure script, and
	  changed the 'prep_tarball' script to build the menuselect
	  metadata so that tarballs of Asterisk will include it and won't
	  require the user to wait while it is extracted after unpacking.

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fixing autofill to be more accurate.
	  Specifically, if calls ahead of the current caller were ringing
	  members (but not yet bridged) there could be available members

	  available members in this scenario, but the queue itself did not

2007-12-07 22:30 +0000 [r91870]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* codecs/codec_zap.c: even though Asterisk explicitly requests that
	  endpoints using G.729 do *not* use Annex B (silence detection and

	  interface does not currently work properly with CNG frames, so
	  trim off the CNG before sending the data

2007-12-07 21:24 +0000 [r91777-91830]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* main/utils.c: Make the lock protecting each thread's list of
	  locks it currently holds recursive. I think that this will fix
	  the situation where some people have said that "core show locks"
	  locks up the CLI. (related to issue #11080)

	* include/asterisk/lock.h: Fix another bug in the DEBUG_THREADS
	  code. The ast_mutex_init() function had the mutex attribute
	  object marked as static. This means that multiple threads
	  initializing locks at the same time could step on each other and
	  end up with improperly initialized locks. (found when tracking
	  down locking issues related to issue #11080)

	* include/asterisk/lock.h: I love fixing lock related errors in the
	  lock debugging code. That's about as ironic as it gets in
	  Asterisk programming land. Anyway, I spotted this bug while
	  trying to track down why systems are locking up and acting weird
	  in issue #11080. The mutex attribute object was marked as static
	  in this function when it should not have been.

	* apps/app_dial.c: * Add channel locking around datastore
	  operations that expect the channel to be locked. * Document why
	  we don't record Local channels in the dialed interfaces list. *
	  Remove the dialed variable as it isn't needed. * Restructure some

	* apps/app_queue.c: * Add channel locking around datastore
	  operations that expect the channel to be locked. * Document why

	  as it wasn't actually needed. * Tweak some formatting to conform
	  to coding guidelines.

	* main/autoservice.c: * Add a bit more of a verbose comment as to
	  why a hangup frame needs to be queued up if autoservice gets a
	  NULL return from ast_read(). * Make the process of queueing the
	  hangup frame more efficient by putting the frame where it is
	  going to end up and avoiding some locking and extra memory
	  allocations and freeing.

	* main/autoservice.c: Hangups that happen during autoservice were
	  not processed appropriately. This is because a hangup actually
	  causes a NULL frame to be received, not a hangup frame. Queueing
	  a hangup if we receive a NULL frame during autoservice corrects
	  this problem (closes issue #11467, reported by jmls, patched by

	  problem. (related to issue #11486)

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fix in an issue in the call forwarding handling
	  code that was causing crashes on every call into a queue. I'm not
	  entirely sure about the logic in this part of the code, so I want

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Reverting extra stuff I didn't mean to
	  commit

	* apps/app_voicemail.c, apps/app_dial.c: The 'G' option for Dial()
	  did not properly handle the case where only a label was provided.
	  This was due to the fact that the answering channel did not have
	  an extension set, so ast_parseable_goto would fail. This fix
	  eliminates the call to ast_parseable_goto on the answering
	  channel since it is a wasteful call. The answering channel and
	  the calling channel are both directed to the same extension and

	* main/utils.c: When DEBUG_THREADS is enabled, we only have the

	* include/asterisk/lock.h: Fix some crashes in chan_iax2 that were
	  reported as happening on Mac systems. It turns out that the
	  problem was the Mac version of the ast_atomic_fetchadd_int()
	  function. The Mac atomic add function returns the _new_ value,
	  while this function is supposed to return the old value. So, the
	  crashes happened on unreferencing objects. If the reference count
	  was decreased to 1, ao2_ref() thought that it had been decreased
	  to zero, and called the destructor. However, there was still an
	  outstanding reference around. (closes issue #11176) (closes issue
	  #11289)

	  suggested by paravoid)

	* main/pbx.c: Make some changes to some additions I made recently
	  for doing channel autoservice when looking up extensions. This
	  code was added to handle the case where a dialplan switch was in
	  use that could block for a long time. However, the way that I
	  added it, it did this for all extension lookups. However, lookups
	  in the in-memory tree of extensions should _not_ take long enough
	  to matter. So, move the autoservice stuff to be only around
	  executing a switch.

	* apps/app_dial.c, main/channel.c, main/global_datastores.c
	  (added), channels/chan_local.c, main/Makefile,
	  include/asterisk/channel.h, include/asterisk/global_datastores.h
	  (added), apps/app_queue.c: A big one... This is the merge of the
	  forward-loop branch. The main change here is that call-forwards
	  can no longer loop. This is accomplished by creating a datastore
	  on the calling channel which has a linked list of all devices
	  dialed. If a forward happens, then the local channel which is
	  created inherits the datastore. If, through this progression of
	  forwards and datastore inheritance, a device is attempted to be
	  dialed a second time, it will simply be skipped and a warning
	  message will be printed to the CLI. After the dialing has been
	  completed, the datastore is detached from the channel and
	  destroyed. This change also introduces some side effects to the
	  code which I shall enumerate here: 1. Datastore inheritance has
	  been backported from trunk into 1.4 2. A large chunk of code has
	  been removed from app_dial. This chunk is the section of code
	  which handles the call forward case after the channel has been
	  requested but before it has been called. This was removed because
	  call-forwarding still works fine without it, it makes the code
	  less error-prone should it need changing, and it made this set of
	  changes much less painful to just have the forwarding handled in
	  one place in each module. 3. Two new files, global_datastores.h
	  and .c have been added. These are necessary since the datastore
	  which is attached to the channel may be created and attached in
	  either app_dial or app_queue, so they need a common place to find
	  the datastore info. This approach was taken in case similar
	  datastores are needed in the future, there will be a common place
	  to add them.

	* main/pbx.c: Removing some seemingly pointless code. This sets a
	  channel variable for every priority executed in the dialplan if
	  you have debug set to anything non-zero. This seems pointless due
	  to the fact that these channel variables are not referenced
	  anywhere else in the code and their names are esoteric enough
	  that they would not be practical to reference in the dialplan.
	  Plus the fact that this behavior isn't documented anywhere means
	  that the change is not likely to cause any disruption. If
	  anything, this may actually cause a slight performance increase
	  if running with debug on. The motivating influence for this code
	  change is the eventwhencalled option for queues. If set to vars,
	  all channel variables will be output to the manager. These
	  unnecessary channel variables make the output a lot more
	  difficult to deal with.

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Recording greetings when using IMAP storage

	* apps/app_queue.c: Two changes with regards to the
	  'eventwhencalled' option of queues.conf 1) Due to some signed vs.
	  unsigned silliness, setting 'eventwhencalled' to 'vars' or 'yes'
	  did exactly the same thing. Thus the sign change of the ast_true
	  call. 2) The vars2manager function overwrote a \n for every
	  channel variable it parsed, resulting in bizarre output for the
	  channel variables. This patch remedies this. (related to issue
	  #11385, however I'm not sure if this will actually be enough to
	  close it)

2007-11-27 21:45 +0000 [r89790]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* main/autoservice.c, main/pbx.c: Merge changes from
	  team/russell/autoservice_1.4 This set of changes fixes an issue
	  that was reported to me on IRC yesterday. The user, d1mas, was
	  using chan_zap for incoming calls and was having DTMF recognition
	  issues in some situations. Specifically, he noticed that the
	  problem occurred when using DISA or WaitExten. He also noticed
	  that when using Read, the problem did not occur. His system also
	  used DUNDi for dialplan lookups. So, he theorized that if the
	  DUNDi lookups blocked for some period of time, that audio from
	  the zap channel could get lost. If the audio got lost, then it
	  wouldn't be run through the DTMF detector, and digits could get
	  lost. He was correct, and the following set of changes fixes the
	  problem. However, the changes go a little bit further than what
	  was necessary to fix this exact problem. 1) I updated
	  pbx_extension_helper() to autoservice the associated channel to
	  handle cases where extension lookups may take a long time. This
	  would normally be a dialplan switch that does some lookup over
	  the network, such as the DUNDi or IAX2 switches. This ensures
	  that even while a DUNDi lookup is blocking, the channel will be
	  continuously serviced. 2) I made a change to the autoservice
	  code. This is actually something that has bothered me for a long
	  time. When a channel is in autoservice, _all_ frames get thrown
	  away. However, some frames really shouldn't be thrown away. The
	  most notable examples are signalling (CONTROL) frames, and DTMF.
	  So, this patch queues up important frames while a channel is in
	  autoservice. When autoservice is stopped on the channel, the
	  queued up frames get stuck back on the channel so that they can
	  get processed instead of thrown away. 3) I made another change to
	  the autoservice code to handle the case where autoservice is
	  started on channels recursively. Previously, you could call
	  ast_autoservice_start() multiple times on a channel, and it would
	  stop the first time ast_autoservice_stop() gets called. Now, it
	  will ensure that autoservice doesn't actually stop until the
	  final call to ast_autoservice_stop().

	  The disposition will be NO ANSWER or ANSWERED, as appropriate.
	  The src is as you'd expect, the destination channel will be one
	  of the channels from the Dial() call, usually the last in the
	  list if more than one chan was specified. With unanswered set to
	  'yes', you will still see this cdr entry in both cases. But in
	  the case where the dial timed out, you will also see a cdr for
	  each line attempted, marked NO ANSWER, with no destination
	  channel name. The new option defaults to 'no', so you don't see
	  the pesky extra cdr's by default, and you will not see the

	  fixes the problem, with a multi-faceted approach. First, we do
	  our best to avoid these messages from being created in the first
	  place, and second, if that fails, we detect when the voicemail
	  message is zero-length and avoid exiting at that point. Reported
	  by: dtyoo Patch by: gkloepfer,tilghman (Closes issue #11083)

	* main/manager.c: Up until this point, the XML output of the
	  manager has been technically invalid, due to the repetition of
	  certain parameters in a single event. This caused various issues
	  for XML parsers, some of which refused to parse at all, given the
	  invalidity of the rendered XML. So this commit fixes the XML
	  output, ensuring that each entity parameter has a unique name,
	  thus ensuring valid XML. Reported by: msetim Patch by: tilghman
	  (Closes issue #10220)

	* res/res_config_odbc.c: Use ESCAPE clause for the first parameter,
	  not just 2nd-Nth parameters. Reported by: apsaras Patch by:

	* main/pbx.c: According to comments in main/pbx.c, it is essential
	  that if we are going to lock the conlock as well as the hints
	  lock, it must be locked in that respective order. In order to
	  prevent a potential deadlock, we need to lock the conlock prior
	  to locking the hints lock in ast_hint_state_changed (see the call
	  stack example on issue #11323 for how this can happen). (closes

	* Asterisk 1.4.14 released.

	* main/loader.c, include/asterisk/module.h,
	  build_tools/make_buildopts_h: Temporarily revert revision 89325,
	  which added md5 magic for keeping track of what build options
	  were used. We agreed that we should remove this before making a
	  1.4 release, and then we can put it back in. Then, we can take a
	  month or so to play around with it to get it how we want it.

2007-11-16 16:47 +0000 [r89325]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* main/loader.c, include/asterisk/module.h,
	  build_tools/make_buildopts_h: To help combat problems where
	  people build external modules (asterisk-addons or others) and
	  then change the build options of the Asterisk build in a way that
	  makes the incompatible without warning, this commit introduces an
	  MD5 signature of the important build-time options and includes
	  that signature into modules when they are built. When the loader
	  loads one of these modules and notices the problem, it will emit
	  a warning to console and refuse to initialize the module, as
	  doing so could cause the system to be unstable or even crash. If
	  you upgrade to this version of Asterisk, you must rebuild *all*
	  of your modules that came from other sources before trying to run
	  this version. If you are using Digium's G.729 binary codec
	  module, you will need v33 or newer.

	* apps/app_meetme.c: Update the SLAStation application to account
	  for the case where the SLA thread has a call out to the station,
	  but the user has pressed a line button to answer the call instead
	  of picking up the handset. If they do, the phone sends out a new
	  INVITE. So, the SLAStation app must check to see if it is picking
	  up a ringing trunk, and ensure that the other stations stop

	* channels/chan_misdn.c, configs/misdn.conf.sample: if we're NT and
	  no number was dialed and overlapdial is set, we wait for the ISDN
	  timeout instead of starting our own timer. added a comment for
	  the misdn.conf.sample for the overlapdial config option.

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c, channels/misdn/isdn_lib_intern.h,
	  channels/chan_misdn.c, channels/misdn/isdn_msg_parser.c: added
	  restart all interfaces Restart_Indicator, to automatically send a
	  RESTART after the L2 of a PTP Port comes up. Also fixed some
	  places where we have send a RELEASE without need for it.

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c, channels/chan_misdn.c: fixed a
	  state/event issue with overlapdial=yes when no extension matched.
	  removed the general sending of a RELEASE_COMPLETE when we receive
	  a RELEASE, this is done by mISDNuser/mISDN. This makes it
	  possible to use asterisk-1.4 with mISDN trunk, but requires users
	  of mISDN/mISDNuser-1.1.X to upgrade to at least mISDNuser-1.1.6
	  (when using the NT mode at all)

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c: fixed the support for CW and therefore
	  for the reject_cause option.

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c, channels/misdn_config.c,
	  channels/misdn/isdn_lib.h, channels/chan_misdn.c,
	  channels/misdn/chan_misdn_config.h, configs/misdn.conf.sample:
	  aded ntkeepcalls option, to avoid droÃpping calls when the L2
	  goes down on a PTP link. There are some pbx which do turn off the
	  L1 for a very short while and restart it immediately. normally
	  T310 should be started and after 10 seconds or so the calls
	  should be dropped, this is a simple fix wihtout this timer.

	* main/pbx.c, include/asterisk/pbx.h: After seeing crashes related
	  to channel variables, I went looking around at the ways that
	  channel variables are handled. In general, they were not handled
	  in a thread-safe way. The channel _must_ be locked when reading
	  or writing from/to the channel variable list. What I have done to
	  improve this situation is to make pbx_builtin_setvar_helper() and
	  friends lock the channel when doing their thing. Asterisk API
	  calls almost all lock the channel for you as necessary, but this
	  family of functions did not. (closes issue #10923, reported by
	  atis) (closes issue #11159, reported by 850t)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: When traversing the list of channel
	  variables here in transmit_invite(), the asterisk channel must be
	  locked, as this data may change at any time. (I have seen
	  numerous reports of crashes related to the handling of channel
	  variables. There are a couple of issues on the bug tracker
	  related to it, but it has also been noted on IRC and mailing
	  lists. So, I am finding and fixing some places where channel
	  variables are handled improperly.)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Fix up some indentation.

	* main/srv.c, include/asterisk/srv.h: Merge changes from
	  asterisk/team/kpfleming/SRV-priority-handling Previously, the SRV
	  record support in Asterisk was broken. There was no guarantee on
	  what record Asterisk would choose to actually use. This set of
	  changes improves the situation by ensuring that Asterisk will
	  choose the highest priority record.

	* main/channel.c: Merge the last bit of changes from
	  asterisk/team/russell/readq-1.4 The issue here is that the
	  channel frame readq handling got broken when the code was
	  converted to use the linked list macros. It caused corruption of
	  the list head and tail pointers. So, I fixed up the usage of the
	  linked list macros and in passing, simplified the code. I also
	  documented what the code is doing, as it was a bit difficult to
	  figure out at first. This bug showed itself with crashes showing
	  messed up head/tail pointers for the readq. However, there are a
	  couple of crashes that aren't quite as obvious, but I think may
	  be related. So, if your bug gets closed by this commit, but you
	  still have a problem, please reopen or create a new bug report.

	  escaped. Fixed this; User also wanted comments to be preserved
	  across dialplan save, but this is impossible at this point in
	  time, because comments are not stored in the dialplan. They are
	  'compiled' out of extensions.conf. The only way to preserve those
	  comments is to use the config file reader/writer that the GUI
	  uses to allow online user edits. extensions.conf is first and
	  foremost, a config file, and is read in by the normal config-file
	  reading routines. Then, it is processed into a dialplan
	  (context/exten structs).

	* pbx/pbx_ael.c: Included some verbage in the check_includes func,
	  to inform the user that included contexts that have no match in

	  or the in-memory contexts, as they may not be there at the time

	  race condition related to the handling of POKEing peers.
	  Essentially, a reference to a peer is held by the scheduler when
	  there are pending callbacks, but the reference count didn't
	  reflect it. So, it was possible for a peer to hit a reference
	  count of zero and have its destructor begin to be called at the
	  same time that the scheduler thread ran a POKE related callback.

	  I checked it out against extensions.conf, and sure enough, empty
	  contexts ARE ok. So, I removed the restriction from AEL. This,
	  though, highlighted a problem with multiple contexts of the same
	  name. This should be OK, also. So, I added the extend keyword to
	  AEL, and it can preceed the 'context' keyword (mixed with
	  'abstract', if nec.). This will turn off the warnings in AEL if
	  the same context name is used 2 or more times. Also, I now call
	  ast_context_find_or_create for contexts now, instead of just
	  ast_context_create; I did this because pbx_config does this. The
	  'extend' keyword thus becomes a statement of intent. AEL can now

	* apps/app_queue.c: Trying to remove a non-dynamic queue member via
	  dynamic means can lead to some interesting (read nasty)
	  situations. This patch clears up the issue by making only dynamic
	  queue members removable via dynamic methods.

2007-10-15 21:10 +0000 [r85717-85720]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: Ensure that no pending state changes are leaked
	  when the device state change thread gets stopped on module
	  unload.

	* apps/app_queue.c: Previously, app_queue created a thread to
	  handle every single device state change. I changed this a while
	  ago in trunk for performance reasons. However, bug 8407 points
	  out that it is actually a race condition, causing device state
	  changes to get processed in random order. So, I backported my
	  changes from trunk to 1.4. (closes issue #8407, patch provided by
	  tim_ringenbach, committed patch by me)

	  cabal95.

2007-10-15 19:22 +0000 [r85604-85649]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* main/utils.c: Be pedantic about handling memory allocation
	  failure.

	* main/utils.c: The loop in the handler for the "core show locks"
	  could potentially block for some amount of time. Be a little bit
	  more careful and prepare all of the output in an intermediary
	  buffer while holding a global resource. Then, after releasing it,
	  send the output to ast_cli().

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Make the default for the srvlookup option to
	  be yes. It doesn't really make sense for it to default to off.
	  The default configuration file has it on, and proper RFC
	  behavior, as indicated by a comment in the code, is for it to be
	  on. So, let's have it on by default to make lives easier. (closes
	  issue #10954, suggested by jtodd)

	* main/asterisk.c, main/cli.c, include/asterisk/logger.h: Fix an
	  issue with console verbosity when running asterisk -rx to execute
	  a command and retrieve its output. The issue was that there was
	  no way for the main Asterisk process to know that the remote
	  console was connecting in the -rx mode. The way that James has
	  fixed this is to have all remote consoles muted by default. Then,
	  regular remote consoles automatically execute a CLI command to
	  unmute themselves when they first start up. (closes issue #10847)
	  Reported by: atis Patches: asterisk-consolemute.diff.txt uploaded

	* Asterisk 1.4.13 released.

2007-10-10 15:56 +0000 [r85316]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* include/asterisk/file.h: I introduced a new member to the
	  ast_filestream struct in 1.4.12, but put it in the middle of the
	  struct, instead of at the end. One of the Debian folks, paravoid,
	  pointed out that this breaks binary compatability with modules
	  compiled against older headers. So, I'm moving the new member to
	  the end of the struct to resolve the situation.

	* Makefile.rules: Enable file dependency tracking for _all_ builds,
	  and not just for builds with dev-mode enabled. I have seen enough
	  problems caused by this that I don't think it's worth keeping. I
	  want to continue to encourage anybody that is interested to
	  continue to run Asterisk from svn. Furthermore, I do not want
	  their systems to break when we change a structure definition in a

	* res/res_jabber.c: Presence packets from a client who's connected

	  considered as buddies. The resource string helps us make the
	  distinction between clients. Closes issue #10707, reported by
	  yusufmotiwala.

	* res/res_jabber.c: Prevent Asterisk from crashing when receiving a
	  presence packet without resource from a buddy that is known to
	  have a resource list. Revert a change I previously made, where
	  Asterisk could point to a freed memory location.

	* pbx/pbx_ael.c: closes issue #10870 ; where a CUT() function call
	  in a switch expr doesn't execute correctly, because the commas in
	  the function args are not converted to vertbars before the func
	  is called. I modified just the switch code to convert the commas
	  to vertbars if there, but if more of these sort of probs are
	  found, I may have to resort to something a little more
	  fundamental. We'll see, I guess.

	  pbx/ael/ael-test/ref.ael-test3, pbx/pbx_ael.c,
	  pbx/ael/ael-test/ref.ael-test5: closes issue #10834 ; where a
	  null input to a switch statement results in a hangup; since
	  switch is implemented with extensions, and the default case is
	  implemented with a '.', and the '.' matches 1 or more remaining
	  characters, the case where 0 characters exist isn't matched, and
	  the extension isn't matched, and the goto fails, and a hangup
	  occurs. Now, when a default case is generated, it also generates
	  a single fixed extension that will match a null input. That
	  extension just does a goto to the default extension for that
	  switch. I played with an alternate solution, where I just tack an
	  extra char onto all the patterns and the goto, but not the
	  default case's pattern. Then even a null input will still have at
	  least one char in it. But it made me nervous, having that extra
	  char in , even if that's a pretty secret and low-level issue.

	* pbx/ael/ael_lex.c, pbx/ael/ael.flex: This issue sort of closes
	  10786; All config files support #include with globbing (you know,

	* main/manager.c, channels/chan_agent.c,
	  include/asterisk/channel.h: if an Agent is redirected, the base
	  channel should actually be redirected. This was causing multiple

2007-09-26 21:35 +0000 [r83910-83943]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: I changed my mind ... I think this should be
	  a LOG_NOTICE.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Add a log message that was requested by the
	  masses in the developer tutorial session at Astricon. chan_sip
	  did not output any message when a call was rejected because the
	  extension was not found. This adds a verbose message (at verbose
	  level 3) to note when this happens.

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: Fix building chan_misdn under dev-mode.
	  (please run the configure script with --enable-dev-mode so this

	* main/app.c: jmls pointed out that unsetting the group and setting
	  the group to the blank string aren't quite the same.

	* build_tools/make_defaults_h: In the source, keys are relative to
	  the datadir, not varlib (which is the same in most cases, but
	  it's good to be accurate). Closes issue #10811

	* doc/realtime.txt: Oops. Removed the unworkable workaround. This
	  note should never have been in the release.

	* main/app.c: Making change to group splitting, as discussed on the
	  -dev list. The main effect of this will be to permit
	  Set(GROUP([cat])=), i.e. unsetting a group.

2007-09-24 07:54 +0000 [r83620]  Christian Richter <christian.richter@beronet.com>

2007-09-22 19:39 +0000 [r83558-83589]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* pbx/pbx_ael.c: This closes issue #10788 -- The exact same fixes
	  are made here for the first arg in the for(arg1; arg2; arg3) {}
	  statement, as were done for the 3rd arg. It can now be an
	  assignment that will embedded in a Set() app, or a macro call, or
	  an app call.

	* pbx/pbx_ael.c: This closes issue #10788 -- the 3rd arg in the for
	  statement is now wrapped in Set() only if there's an '=' in that
	  string. Otherwise, if it begins with '&', then a Macro call is
	  generated; otherwise it is made into an app call. A bit more
	  accomodating, keeps the new guys happy, and the guys with ael-1
	  code should be happy, too

	* apps/app_system.c: The System() and TrySystem() applications can
	  take a substantial amount of time to execute while not servicing
	  the channel. So, put the channel in autoservice while the command
	  is being executed. (closes issue #10726, reported by mnicholson)

	* funcs/func_curl.c: Using curl can take a substantial amount of
	  time, so the channel should be autoserviced while waiting for it
	  to complete. (closes issue #10725, reported by mnicholson)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: When handling a reload of chan_iax2, don't
	  use an ao2_callback() to POKE all peers. Instead, use an
	  iterator. By using an iterator, the peers container is not locked
	  while the POKE is being done. It can cause a deadlock if the
	  peers container is locked because poking a peer will try to lock
	  pvt structs, while there is a lot of other code that will hold a
	  pvt lock when trying to go lock the peers container. (reported to
	  me directly by Loic Didelot. Thank you for the debug info!)

2007-09-18 20:56 +0000 [r82867]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* main/manager.c: Fix a memory leak that can occur on systems under
	  higher load. The issue is that when events are appended to the
	  master event queue, they use the number of active sessions as a
	  use count so it will know when all active sessions at the time
	  the event happened have consumed it. However, the handling of the
	  number of sessions was not properly synchronized, so the use
	  count was not always correct, causing an event to disappear
	  early, or get stuck in the event queue for forever. (closes issue
	  #9238, reported by bweschke, patch from Ivan, modified by me)

2007-09-18 20:09 +0000 [r82865]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: Moving the logic for handling an empty
	  membername to the create_member function so that there is a
	  common place where this occurs instead of being spread out to
	  several different places.

2007-09-18 18:59 +0000 [r82834]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: there is no need for conditional logic to

	* apps/app_voicemail.c, main/stdtime/localtime.c: Put a memset in
	  ast_localtime() instead of a couple places in app_voicemail to
	  prevent the problem everywhere instead of just a couple of
	  places. (related to issue #10746)

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Initialize some memory to fix crashes when
	  leaving voicemail. This problem was fixed by running Asterisk
	  under valgrind. (closes issue #10746, reported by arcivanov,
	  patched by me) *** IMPORTANT NOTE: We need to check to see if
	  this same bug exists elsewhere.

	* res/res_features.c: Handle the case where there are multiple
	  dynamic features with the same digit mapping, but won't always
	  match the activated on/by access controls. In that case, the code
	  needs to keep trying features for a match. (reported by Atis on

2007-09-14 17:48 +0000 [r82394]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_zap.c: If a channel does not have an owner, do not

	  the chan_usbradio-1.4 branch every time the configure script gets
	  changed

	* channels/chan_usbradio.c (removed), channels/xpmr (removed),
	  channels/Makefile: Remove chan_usbradio from the main 1.4 branch.
	  It can't live here because we have a strict policy to not include

2007-09-13 20:11 +0000 [r82344]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* cdr/cdr_csv.c: Fix a crash that could occur in cdr_csv when
	  mutliple threads tried to close the same file. Do we actually
	  need the locking here? What happens if you open the same file
	  twice, and two threads try to write to it at the same time? Is
	  fputs() going to write out the entire line at once? I suspect
	  that it could be possible for the second fopen to run during the
	  first fputs, so the position could be in the middle of the
	  previously written line... Issue 10347, initial patch by
	  explidous (but I removed all of the paranoia stuff..)

2007-09-13 18:57 +0000 [r82337-82339]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: Added logic to handle the unlikely case that
	  someone has two queues with the same name. Asterisk will log a
	  warning message letting the user know that one was already
	  defined with that name and is it skipping all further instances.
	  This also will work for realtime queues but in order for that to
	  happen, the user would have to trigger a perfectly timed reload
	  as a realtime queue is being looked up, which is highly unlikely
	  (but taken care of nonetheless).

	  by an XXX comment left in the code. The problem was harmless,
	  however.

2007-09-12 21:28 +0000 [r82291]  Tilghman Lesher <tlesher@digium.com>

	* apps/app_meetme.c: remove a race condition for the creation of

2007-09-12 20:12 +0000 [r82285]  Tilghman Lesher <tlesher@digium.com>

	* main/stdtime/private.h, main/stdtime/tzfile.h,
	  include/asterisk/localtime.h, main/stdtime/localtime.c: Working
	  on issue #10531 exposed a rather nasty 64-bit issue on
	  ast_mktime, so we updated the localtime.c file from source. Next
	  we'll have to write ast_strptime to match.

2007-09-12 15:16 +0000 [r82278-82280]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* main/asterisk.c: Clean up the output of "asterisk -h". This
	  tweaks the wording and wraps lines at 80 characters. (closes

	* res/res_agi.c: revert patch from issue #10553, as someone not
	  using fastagi reported that this broke their system.

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Accidentally committed changes to
	  app_voicemail which do NOT need to be in the 1.4 branch yet.
	  reverting...

	* apps/app_voicemail.c, apps/app_queue.c: We should only initialize
	  a realtime queue when it is allocated, not every time we access
	  it. This prevents the members ao2_container from being
	  reallocated every time the queue is accessed. I also removed a
	  debug message I had accidentally left in on a previous commit.

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fix another missing unref of member objects.
	  This one was pointed out by Marta. When building the outgoing
	  list in try_calling(), a member reference is stored in each
	  outgoing entry. However, when this list got destroyed, the
	  reference was not released.

2007-09-11 20:36 +0000 [r82261]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* main/cdr.c: this change should fix issue # 10659 -- what I worry
	  about is how many other bug reports it may generate. Hopefully,
	  we can please the/a majority. Hopefully. We shall see. Calls not
	  marked ANSWERED and with only one channel name will not be
	  posted. This should eliminate the double CDR's.

2007-09-11 16:05 +0000 [r82252]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: All instances of ao2_iterators which were just
	  named 'i' have been renamed to 'mem_iter' so that when refcounted
	  queues are merged into trunk, there will be little confusion
	  regarding iterator names, especially when a queue and member
	  iterator are used in the same function.

2007-09-11 16:03 +0000 [r82250]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* pbx/pbx_dundi.c: The sample dundi.conf claims support for a

	* apps/app_queue.c: Add a missing unref of a queue member in an
	  error handling block

	* apps/app_queue.c: Document why membercount can not simply be
	  replaced by ao2_container_count()

	* main/astobj2.c: backport astobj2 race condition fix. This
	  function is the exact same as trunk so it applies here as well.

	* main/asterisk.c: Fix a small memory leak. ast_unregister_atexit()
	  did not free the entry it removed.

	* .cleancount: (closes issue #10672) Bump the cleancount so that a
	  "make clean" will be forced. This is needed because my fix in
	  revision 81599 made a change to a data structure in file.h, and
	  since file dependency tracking is only on with dev-mode enabled,
	  file format modules that don't get rebuilt may crash, as is the
	  case with this issue. This makes me wonder - how much faster does
	  the code build without the file dependency tracking enabled? If
	  it doesn't make much of a difference, then it may be worth just
	  keeping it on all of the time, or perhaps just not in release
	  tarballs, so that this type of issue is avoided.

2007-09-07 19:48 +0000 [r81923]  Jason Parker <jparker@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: Allow the MEMBERINTERFACE variable to be used

	  2) Tested by: kenw, russell Resolve a deadlock that occurs when
	  doing a SIP transfer to parking. I come across this type of
	  deadlock fairly often it seems. It is very important to mind the
	  boundary between the channel driver and the core in respect to
	  the channel lock and the channel-pvt lock. Channel drivers lock
	  to lock the pvt and then the channel once it calls into the core,
	  while the core will do it in the opposite order. The way this is
	  avoided is by having channel drivers either release their pvt
	  lock while calling into the core, or such as in this case,
	  unlocking the pvt just long enough to acquire the channel lock.

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fixed broken behavior of a reload on realtime
	  queues. Prior to this patch, if a reload was issued and a
	  realtime queue had callers waiting in it, then the queue would be
	  removed from the queue list, but it would not actually be freed
	  (in fact, a debug message warning about a memory leak would come

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c, channels/chan_misdn.c: Fixed a severe
	  issue where a misdn_read would lock the channel, but read would
	  not return because it blocks. later chan_misdn would try to queue
	  a frame like a AST_CONTROL_ANSWER which could result in a
	  deadlock situation. misdn_read will now not block forever
	  anymore, and we don't queue the ANSWER frame at all when we
	  already was called with misdn_answer -> answer would be called
	  twice. Also we don't explicitly send a RELEASE_COMPLETE on
	  receiption of a RELEASE anymore, because mISDN does that for us,
	  this resulted in a problem on some switches, which would block
	  our port after some calls for a short while.

	* apps/app_queue.c: This patch, in essence, will correctly pause a
	  realtime queue member and reflect those changes in the realtime
	  engine. (issue #10424, reported by irroot, patch by me) This
	  patch creates a new function called update_realtime_member_field,
	  which is a generic function which will allow any one field of a
	  realtime queue member to be updated. This patch only uses this
	  function to update the paused status of a queue member, but it
	  lays the foundation for persisting the state of a realtime member
	  the same way that static members' state is maintained when using
	  the persistentmembers setting

	* apps/app_queue.c: This fix creates a more accurate way of
	  detecting whether realtime members were deleted. (closes issue

	  about this patch is that queue members now have a "realtime"
	  field which will be true if the member is a realtime member. This
	  means we can check this value prior to certain processing if it
	  should ONLY be done for realtime members.

	  res_config_mysql (closes issue #10573, reported by chrisvaughan,
	  patch suggested by chrisvaughan as well)

	* apps/app_queue.c: Resolve a potential deadlock. In this case, a
	  single queue is locked, then the queue list. In changethread(),
	  the queue list is locked, and then each individual queue is
	  locked. Under the right circumstances, this could deadlock. As
	  such, I have unlocked the individual queue before locking the
	  queue list, and then locked the queue back after the queue list
	  is unlocked.

	* channels/chan_agent.c: DTMF begin frames should be ignored so
	  that when an agent acks a call with the '#' key, he doesn't cause

2007-08-25 17:37 +0000 [r80895]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix some issues with the handling of the
	  scheduler in chan_iax2. Most of the places that scheduled items
	  to be executed by the scheduler thread did not signal the
	  scheduler thread to wake up so that it could recalculate the time
	  until the next action. These changes will make the scheduler
	  thread more responsive and ensure that actions get executed as
	  close to when intended as possible instead of it being possible
	  for very long delays.

	  work once the dnsmgr is able to resolve the host. (closes issue
	  #10521, patch by jamesgolovich)

	* main/dsp.c: Improve the debouncing logic in the DTMF detector to
	  fix some reliability issues. Previously, this code used a shift
	  register of hits and non-hits. However, if the start of the digit
	  isn't clean, it is possible for the leading edge detector to miss
	  the digit. These changes replace the flawed shift register logic
	  and also does the debouncing on the trailing edge as well.
	  (closes issue #10535, many thanks to softins for the patch)

	* channels/chan_gtalk.c: Closes issue #10509 Googletalk calls are
	  answered too early, which results in CDRs wrongly stating that a
	  call was ANSWERED when the calling party cancelled a call before
	  before being established. We must not answer the call upon

	* funcs/func_timeout.c: Revert very broken fix for issue #10540 ...
	  none of these values take ms so I don't know what I was thinking

	* funcs/func_timeout.c: Fix func_timeout to take values in floating

	  consists of channels 1 through <x> with no gaps in the sequence

2007-08-23 17:02 +0000 [r80360-80499]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix some code where it was possible for a
	  reference to a peer to not get released when it should. Thank you
	  to Marta Carbone for pointing this out!

	* main/astobj2.c, include/asterisk/astobj2.h, channels/chan_iax2.c:
	  This is a hack to maintain old behavior of chan_iax2. This
	  ensures that if the peers and users are being stored in a linked
	  list, that they go in the list in the same order that the older
	  code used. This is necessary to maintain the behavior of which
	  peers and users get matched when traversing the container.

	* res/res_agi.c: Revert res_agi fix that didn't quite work until we
	  get it right ...

	* include/asterisk/astobj2.h: Add some more documentation on
	  iterating ao2 containers. The documentation implies that is
	  possible to miss an object or see an object twice while
	  iterating. After looking through the code and talking with
	  mmichelson, I have documented the exact conditions under which
	  this can happen (which are rare and harmless in most cases).

	* main/astobj2.c: When converting this code to use the list macros,
	  I changed it so objects are added to the head of a bucket instead
	  of the tail. However, while looking over code with mmichelson, we
	  noticed that the algorithm used in ao2_iterator_next requires
	  that items are added to the tail. This wouldn't have caused any
	  huge problem, but it wasn't correct. It meant that if an object
	  was added to a container while you were iterating it, and it was
	  added to the same bucket that the current element is in, then the
	  new object would be returned by ao2_iterator_next, and any other
	  objects in the bucket would be bypassed in the traversal.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Don't crash when using realtime in chan_sip
	  without an insecure setting in the database. (closes issue
	  #10348, reported by link55, fixed by me)

	* main/astobj2.c (added), main/Makefile, include/asterisk/astobj2.h
	  (added), doc/iax.txt, UPGRADE.txt, include/asterisk/strings.h,
	  channels/chan_iax2.c: Merge changes from
	  team/russell/iax_refcount. This set of changes fixes problems
	  with the handling of iax2_user and iax2_peer objects. It was very
	  possible for a thread to still hold a reference to one of these
	  objects while a reload operation tries to delete them. The fix
	  here is to ensure that all references to these objects are
	  tracked so that they can't go away while still in use. To
	  accomplish this, I used the astobj2 reference counted object
	  model. This code has been in one of Luigi Rizzo's branches for a
	  long time and was primarily developed by one of his students,
	  Marta Carbone. I wanted to go ahead and bring this in to 1.4
	  because there are other problems similar to the ones fixed by
	  these changes, so we might as well go ahead and use the new
	  astobj if we're going to go through all of the work necessary to
	  fix the problems. As a nice side benefit of these changes, peer
	  and user handling got more efficient. Using astobj2 lets us not
	  hold the container lock for peers or users nearly as long while
	  iterating. Also, by changing a define at the top of chan_iax2.c,
	  the objects will be distributed in a hash table, drastically
	  increasing lookup speed in these containers, which will have a
	  very big impact on systems that have a large number of users or
	  peers. The use of the hash table will be made the default in
	  trunk. It is not the default in 1.4 because it changes the
	  behavior slightly. Previously, since peers and users were stored
	  in memory in the same order they were specified in the
	  configuration file, you could influence peer and user matching
	  order based on the order they are specified in the configuration.
	  The hash table does not guarantee any order in the container, so
	  this behavior will be going away. It just means that you have to
	  be a little more careful ensuring that peers and users are
	  matched explicitly and not forcing chan_iax2 to have to guess
	  which user is the right one based on secret, host, and access
	  list settings, instead of simply using the username. If you have
	  any questions, feel free to ask on the asterisk-dev list.

	* res/res_agi.c: Juggie in #asterisk-dev was reporting problems
	  where fgets would return without reading the whole line when
	  using fastagi. When this happens, errno was set to EINTR or
	  EAGAIN. This patch accounts for the possibility and lets fgets
	  continue in that case.

	* res/res_musiconhold.c: This patch fixes a bug where reloading the
	  module with "module reload" did not delete classes from memory
	  that were no longer in the config. This patch fixes that problem
	  as well as another one. Previously, if you reloaded MOH using the
	  "moh reload" CLI command, which behaved differently than "module
	  reload ...", MOH had to be stopped on every channel and started
	  again immediately. However, there was no way to tell what class
	  was being used, so they would all fall back to the default class.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix more deadlocks in chan_iax2 that were

	  deadlock avoidance when queueing frames on to the ast_channel
	  owner of the IAX2 pvt struct. This was already handled for
	  regular frames, but ast_queue_hangup and ast_queue_control were
	  still used directly. Making these changes introduced even more
	  places where the IAX2 pvt struct can disappear in the context of
	  a function holding its lock due to calling a function that has to
	  unlock/lock it to avoid deadlocks. I went through and fixed all
	  of these places to account for this possibility. (issue #10362,

	  item to the end of the list. This makes Asterisk endlessy loop
	  whenever it needs to read the list. Jids with different resource
	  and priority values, like in Gmail's and GoogleTalk's jabber
	  clients put that problem in evidence. Upon reception of a 'from'
	  attribute with an empty resource string, Asterisk crashes when
	  trying to access the found->cap pointer if the resource list for
	  the given buddy is not empty. This situation is perfectly valid
	  and must be handled. The Gizmoproject's jabber client put that
	  problem in evidence. Also added a few comments in the code as
	  well as a handle for the capabilities from Gmail's jabber client,
	  which are stored in a caps:c tag rather than the usual c tag.
	  Closes issue #10184.

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Removing some extra debug code I left in my
	  last commit

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Quite a few changes regarding IMAP storage.
	  1. instead of using inboxcount as the core message counting
	  function, we use messagecount instead. This makes it possible to
	  count messages in folders besides just INBOX and Old. 2.
	  inboxcount and hasvoicemail now use messagecount as their means
	  of determining return values. 3. Added a copy_message function
	  for IMAP storage. Unfortunately I don't have the means to test
	  it, but it seems like a pretty straightforward function. 4.
	  Removed a #ifndef IMAP_STORAGE and matching #endif from
	  leave_voicemail for a couple of reasons. One, we want to support
	  copying mail to multiple IMAP boxes, and two, IMAP was broken
	  because a STORE macro had been moved into this section of code.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: I broke canreinvite...Now I'm fixing it. I
	  put some new code in the wrong place and so I've reverted the
	  canreinvite section to how it was and put my new code where it
	  should be.

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Fix subscriptions to multiple mailboxes for
	  ODBC_STORAGE. Also, leave a comment for this to be fixed for
	  IMAP_STORAGE, as well. I left IMAP alone since I know MarkM was
	  working on this code right now for another reason. This is broken
	  even worse in trunk, but for a different reason. The fact that
	  the mailbox option supported multiple mailboxes is completely not
	  obvious from the code in the channel drivers. Anyway, I will fix
	  that in another commit ...

	* apps/app_meetme.c: Fix a problem with the combination of the 'F'
	  option to pass DTMF through a conference and options that use
	  DTMF to activate various features. The problem was that the BEGIN
	  frame would be passed through, but the END frame would get
	  intercepted to activate a feature. Then, the other conference
	  members would hear DTMF for forever, which they didn't seem to
	  like very much. (closes issue #10400, reported by stevefeinstein,

	* main/config.c, channels/chan_sip.c, include/asterisk/config.h:
	  Changed the behavior of sip's realtime_peer function to match the
	  corresponding way of matching for non-realtime peers. Now matches
	  are made on both the IP address and port number, or if the
	  insecure setting is set to "port" then just match on the IP
	  address. In order to accomplish this, I also added a new API
	  call, ast_category_root, which returns the first variable of an
	  ast_category struct

	  blitzrage Patches: bug0010194 uploaded by vovochka Tested by:
	  blitzrage Fix a problem when you call Voicemail() with multiple
	  mailboxes specified and ODBC_STORAGE is in use. The audio part of
	  the message was only given to the first mailbox specified.

	* main/utils.c, include/asterisk/lock.h, main/astmm.c: Add some
	  improvements to lock debugging. These changes take effect with
	  DEBUG_THREADS enabled and provide the following: * This will keep
	  track of which locks are held by which thread as well as which
	  lock a thread is waiting for in a thread-local data structure. A
	  reference to this structure is available on the stack in the
	  dummy_start() function, which is the common entry point for all
	  threads. This information can be easily retrieved using gdb if
	  you switch to the dummy_start() stack frame of any thread and
	  print the contents of the lock_info variable. * All of the
	  thread-local structures for keeping track of this lock
	  information are also stored in a list so that the information can
	  be dumped to the CLI using the "core show locks" CLI command.
	  This introduces a little bit of a performance hit as it requires
	  additional underlying locking operations inside of every
	  lock/unlock on an ast_mutex. However, the benefits of having this
	  information available at the CLI is huge, especially considering
	  this is only done in DEBUG_THREADS mode. It means that in most
	  cases where we debug deadlocks, we no longer have to request
	  access to the machine to analyze the contents of ast_mutex_t
	  structures. We can now just ask them to get the output of "core
	  show locks", which gives us all of the information we needed in
	  most cases. I also had to make some additional changes to astmm.c
	  to make this work when both MALLOC_DEBUG and DEBUG_THREADS are
	  enabled. I disabled tracking of one of the locks in astmm.c
	  because it gets used inside the replacement memory allocation
	  routines, and the lock tracking code allocates memory. This
	  caused infinite recursion.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Only pass through HOLD and UNHOLD control
	  frames when the mohinterpret option is set to "passthrough". This
	  was pointed out by Kevin in the middle of a training session.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Don't reuse the timespec that was set to 0
	  in the previous timedwait as it will just return immediately.
	  Also, fix some logic so the thread's lock isn't unlocked twice in
	  the weird case of dynamic threads getting acquired right after a
	  timeout. (pointed out by SteveK)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix some race conditions which have been
	  causing weird problems in chan_iax2. The most notable problem is
	  that people have been seeing storms of VNAK frames being sent due
	  to really old frames mysteriously being in the retransmission
	  queue and never getting removed. It was possible that a dynamic
	  thread got created, but did not acquire its lock before the
	  thread that created it signals it to perform an action. When this
	  happens, the thread will sleep until it hits a timeout, and then
	  get destroyed. So, the action never gets performed and in some
	  cases, means a frame doesn't get transmitted and never gets freed
	  since the scheduler never gets a chance to reschedule
	  transmission. Another less severe race condition is in the
	  handling of a timeout for a dynamic thread. It was possible for
	  it to be acquired to perform at action at the same time that it
	  hit a timeout. When this occurs, whatever action it was acquired
	  for would never get performed. (patch contributed by Mihai and
	  SteveK) (closes issue #10289) (closes issue #10248) (closes issue
	  #10232) (possibly related to issue #10359)

	* apps/app_queue.c: Fixes an issue I introduced to queues wherein a

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix an issue that could potentially cause
	  corruption of the global iax frame queue. In the network_thread()
	  loop, it traverses the list using the AST_LIST_TRAVERSE_SAFE
	  macro. However, to remove an element of the list within this
	  loop, it used AST_LIST_REMOVE, instead of
	  AST_LIST_REMOVE_CURRENT, which I believe could leave some of the
	  internal variables of the SAFE macro invalid. Mihai says that he
	  already made this change in his local copy and it didn't help his

	* Makefile, build_tools/make_buildopts_h: AST_DEVMODE was defined
	  in trunk, but not in 1.4. When Asterisk is compiled under dev
	  mode, AST_DEVMODE will get defined in buildopts.h. Change 1.4 to
	  define it in the same way that trunk does. Also, revert the
	  change that added this define in the Makefile The advantage to
	  doing it this way is that buildopts.h gets installed when you
	  install Asterisk. Then, when building any out of tree modules, or
	  building asterisk-addons, these modules know which options the
	  rest of Asterisk was built with.

	* Makefile, main/logger.c: Fixes to get ast_backtrace working

	* apps/app_queue.c: Added a membercount variable to call_queue
	  struct which keeps track of the number of logged in members in a
	  particular queue. This makes it so that the 'n' option for
	  Queue() can act properly depending on which strategy is used. If
	  the strategy is roundrobin, rrmemory, or ringall, we want to ring
	  each phone once before moving on in the dialplan. However, if any
	  other strategy is used, we will only ring one phone since it
	  cannot be guaranteed that a different phone will ring on
	  subsequent attempts to ring a phone. As a side effect of this,
	  the QUEUE_MEMBER_COUNT dialplan function now just reads the
	  membercount variable instead of traversing through the member
	  list to figure out how many members there are. Special thanks to
	  blitzrage for helping to test this out. (closes issue #10127,

	* configure.ac: add a check for gethostbyname_r so we can simplify
	  the handling e.g. in utils.c Also add comments on a couple of
	  features which are not working on FreeBSD. All the above has been
	  already done in trunk so the merge must be blocked. Can someone
	  please regenerate ./configure ?

	* Makefile, channels/chan_zap.c, main/say.c: Add
	  -Wdeclaration-after-statement to AST_DEVMODE flags to catch
	  variable declarations in the middle of a block. Fix the few
	  instances of the above spotted out by the compiler. All of this
	  has been already done or is not applicable in trunk, so the merge
	  of this change will be blocked.

	* apps/app_meetme.c: cast a time_t so that it does not conflict
	  with the print format. This change was already done on trunk so
	  this change needs to be blocked from merging.

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: A few changes, the ultimate goal of which
	  is to keep better track of the number of messages that a mailbox
	  currently has. A description of the changes: 1. Changed the
	  "updated" field of the vm_state struct to act more as a binary
	  semaphore than a counting semaphore, since its current
	  implementation made the inboxcount function not work properly.
	  This change falls in line with a change made by UPenn with their
	  IMAP setup and helps to sync our changes with theirs. 2.
	  Eliminated some redundant calls to get_vm_state_by_mailbox inside
	  leave_voicemail 3. Use the play_folder variable to keep track of
	  the number of old and new messages in a mailbox as the messages
	  are deleted 4. Added an increment to the number of new messages
	  that was not there previously in the leave_voicemail function

	  The reason is that codec_g729a will unregister itself from the
	  list of available translators will all licenses are in use. So,
	  the first time the function got called, the right translation
	  path was allocated. However, the second time it got called, the
	  code would not find a translation path to/from g729 and make the
	  call fail, even if the channel actually already had a g729
	  translation path allocated. (SPD-32)

	* res/res_jabber.c: Adding a few Todo's to res_jabber so we don't
	  forget.

	* res/res_jabber.c: Ok, we found out that this is not about if you
	  have any *active* clients using TLS, but if you have initialized
	  TLS at all during the lifetime of the module. So if you reload to
	  disable TLS, it won't help.

	* res/res_jabber.c: If you have a jabber client that uses TLS,
	  refuse unload. Bad fix, but will prevent crashes while we are
	  trying to find a workaround. Iksemel development seems to have
	  stalled and we might have to stop using the TCP/TLS connections
	  in that library and use our own, which would scale better from a
	  poll/select perspective I guess. It would also make it easier to
	  migrate to OpenSSL and stop Asterisk from depending on both
	  OpenSSL and GnuTLS.

	* include/asterisk/jabber.h, res/res_jabber.c: Issue #9738 - Make
	  sure we can unload res_jabber. Patch by phsultan - thanks! Due to

	  out a way to handle that without us having to patch iksemel, let
	  us know in the bug report. Thanks.

	* include/asterisk/linkedlists.h: This bug has been hanging over my
	  head ever since I wrote this SLA code. Every time I tried to go
	  debug it by adding some debug output, the behavior would change.
	  It turns out I wasn't crazy. I had the following piece of code:
	  if (remove) AST_LIST_REMOVE_CURRENT(...); Well,
	  AST_LIST_REMOVE_CURRENT was not wrapped in braces, so my
	  conditional statement didn't do much good at all. It always ran
	  at least all of the macro minus the first statement, so I was
	  seeing list entries magically disappear when they weren't
	  supposed to. After many hours of debugging, I have come to this

	  by 9717, where when several targets are specified for a dial, if

	  new disposition, NULL, is at the lowest level, and the
	  disposition get init'd to NULL. Then, next up is FAIL, and next
	  up is BUSY, then NOANSWER, then ANSWERED. All the related set
	  routines will only do so if the disposition value to be set to is
	  greater than what's already there. This gives the intended
	  effect. So, if all the targets are busy, you'd get BUSY for the
	  call disposition. If all get BUSY, but one, and that one rings is
	  not answered, you get NOANSWER. If by some freak of nature, the
	  NULL value doesn't get overridden, then the disp2str routine will
	  report NOANSWER as before. ........

	* main/channel.c: Fix YADB (Yet Another DTMF Bug) ((C) Russell
	  Bryant, 2007, TM, Patent Pending). This set of changes came from
	  a debugging session I had with Dwayne Hubbard. When he called
	  into his home FXO, ran the Echo application, and pressed a digit,
	  the digit would be echoed back and would never end. This is
	  fixed, along with a couple other little improvements. * When
	  chan_zap is in the middle of playing a digit to a channel, it
	  feeds back null frames, not voice frames. So, I have modified
	  ast_read to check the timing on emulated DTMF when it receives
	  null frames, in addition to where it was doing this on voice
	  frames. * Make a tweak to setting the duration on emulated DTMF
	  digits. If there was no duration specified, it set it to be the
	  minimum, instead of the default. * Instead of timing the emulated
	  digits off of the number of samples in audio frames that pass
	  through, just use time values. Now there is no code in this
	  section that assumes 8kHz audio.

	* main/channel.c: Merge changes from team/russell/inband_dtmf ...
	  Fix some issues related to generating inband DTMF. There are two
	  changes here: 1) The list of DTMF tones in the senddigit_begin()
	  function explicitly specified 100ms of the tone followed by 100ms
	  of silence. This really broke things with the way that Asterisk
	  now wants complete control over when the digit begins and ends.
	  So, regardless of what Asterisk really wanted to do, this was
	  going to play out the tone at the length it wanted to. This
	  caused various problems like DTMF translation to inband to be
	  extremely unreliable. The list of tones has been changed so that
	  the correct DTMF tone is played indefinitely until Asterisk tells
	  it to stop. 2) ast_write() had to be modified to let a DTMF_END
	  frame get processed even when a generator is present. This is how
	  the tone will finally get stopped. (issues #8944, #9250, #9348,
	  maybe others. Thanks to mdu113 from #8944 for the testing and
	  feedback!)

	* channels/chan_agent.c: Fix a weird problem where when a caller
	  talking to someone sitting behind an agent channel sent a digit,
	  the digit would be played to the agent for forever. This is
	  because chan_agent always returned -1 from its send_digit_begin
	  and _end callbacks. This non-zero return value indicates to the
	  Asterisk core that it would like an inband DTMF generator put on
	  the channel. However, this is the wrong thing to do. It should
	  *always* return 0, instead. When the digit begin and end
	  functions are called on the proxied channel, the underlying
	  channel will indicate whether inband DTMF is needed or not, and
	  the generator will be put on that one, and not the Agent channel.

	  | 5 lines Bug 9557 - Specifying the GetVar AMI action without a
	  Channel parameter can cause Asterisk to crash. The reason this
	  needs to be fixed in the functions instead of in AMI is because
	  Channel can legitimately be NULL, such as when retrieving global
	  variables. ........

	  upload files to Asterisk. So, this commit adds this in the most
	  minimally invasive way that we could come up with. A lot of work
	  on minimime was done by Steve Murphy. He fixed a lot of bugs in
	  the parser, and updated it to be thread-safe. The ability to
	  check permissions of active manager sessions was added by Dwayne
	  Hubbard. Then, hacking this all together and do doing the
	  modifications necessary to the HTTP interface was done by me.

	* apps/app_meetme.c: Fix a few problems with SLA. (issue #9459,
	  reported by francesco_r, fixed by me) * The original behavior was
	  that if one station put a call on hold, another one picked it up,
	  and then hung up, the code would still consider the call on hold
	  by the first station, so the trunk would not be hung up. However,
	  to better comply with what most people seem to expect it to
	  behave, it will now hang up the trunk. * Fix a problem with
	  "barge=no". This was only intended to prevent people from joining
	  calls that are in progress. However, it also prevented other
	  people from picking up a call that was on hold. This has been
	  fixed. * When there are no active stations on a trunk and it is
	  on hold, the code now indicates the HOLD and UNHOLD conditions to
	  the trunk channel. This allows music on hold to be played to the
	  trunk when it is on hold.

	  directory into a single LaTeX formatted document so that we can
	  generate a PDF, HTML, or other formats from this information. *
	  Add a CLI command to dump the application documentation into
	  LaTeX format which will only be include if the configure script
	  is run with --enable-dev-mode. * The PDF turned out to be close
	  to 1 MB, so it is not included. However, you can simply run "make
	  asterisk.pdf" to generate it yourself. We may include it in
	  release tarballs or have automatically generated ones on the web
	  site, but that has yet to be decided.

2007-03-15 18:13 +0000 [r58923]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Don't assume that the pvt structure will
	  still exist after calling schedule_delivery as it may not. (issue
	  #9278 reported by fmachado)

2007-03-14 19:18 +0000 [r58894-58906]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Some people like to put "limitonpeer"
	  instead of "limitonpeers" in their configuration. While we're at
	  it, support "limitonpeerz" and "limitonpeerssssss". (inspired by
	  issue #9172)

	* doc/sla.pdf, doc/sla.tex: Add a more basic example setup to the
	  examples section

	* doc/security.txt, /: Merged revisions 58896 via svnmerge from

	  3 lines Add a note to the security file that the Asterisk CLI and
	  log files may contain sensitive information, and that people
	  should keep this in mind. ........

	* configs/sla.conf.sample, apps/app_meetme.c: By default, don't
	  attempt to do any CallerID handling at all with SLA because it is
	  known to not work properly in some situations. However, add an
	  option to enable it for those that would like to use it anyway.
	  The short story behind this is that to properly handle CallerID
	  with SLA, we need the ability to change the CallerID on an
	  existing call, and we are not ready to handle that.

	* funcs/func_strings.c: Issue 9162 -
	  pbx_substitute_variables_helper assumes the buffer is initialized
	  to all zeroes. This fixes a case where it wasn't.

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: Add

	  it an option! (issue #8821 reported by kokoskarokoska)

2007-03-10 18:11 +0000 [r58638-58705]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Fix a few more places in chan_iax2 where
	  the ast_frame used for receiving a frame was not properly
	  initialized. - Interpolating a frame when the jitterbuffer is in
	  use - decrypting a frame when IAX2 encryption is on - frames in
	  an IAX2 trunk

	* apps/app_meetme.c: Make the compiler happy and initialize a
	  variable.

	* doc/sla.pdf (added), doc/sla.txt (removed), doc/sla.tex (added):
	  Merge some updates to the SLA documentation. I plan to keep
	  working on this to explain all of the expected behavior with call
	  handling, configuration details for specific phones, and other
	  things. However, I got tired of doing it in plain text, so I
	  switched to using LaTeX. I have included the PDF version. I
	  haven't been able to get a nice looking plain text version out of
	  it yet, but I'm not terribly concerned since this is supposed to
	  be more of the manual, while the plain text sample configuration
	  file is the reference.

	* apps/app_meetme.c: Hang up the channel that put the call on hold

	  if the station originated the call that it is putting on hold,
	  don't hang up the trunk if it was the only station on the call
	  and it is hanging up due to hold and not a normal hangup.

	  7 lines Fix a problem where the Asterisk channel name could be
	  that of the wrong IAX2 user for a call. This is because the first
	  step of choosing this name is to look for an IAX2 peer that
	  happens to have the same IP/port number that this call is coming
	  from and assuming that is it. However, this is not always
	  correct. So, I have made it change this name after authentication
	  happens since at that point, we have an exact match. ........

	  passthrough is handled in MeetMe. * Fix a bug that exposed itself
	  when using a Local channel on the trunk side in SLA. The
	  station's channel needs to be passed to the dial API when dialing
	  the trunk. * Change a WARNING message to DEBUG in channel.h. This

	  made the SLA code event driven instead of having to act in a lot
	  of busy loops while dialing things to wait for state changes.
	  This makes the code more efficient and readable at the same time.
	  * I have implemented a couple of new features. The first is
	  inbound trunk ringing timeouts. This is an option that defines
	  how long to let an incoming call on a trunk to ring. * I have
	  also implemented ring timeouts for stations. They may be
	  specified for the entire station, meaning it is how long to let
	  the station ring before giving up. You can also specify a ring
	  timeout for a specific trunk on a station. So, you can say that
	  you only want a specific station to ring 5 seconds if it is line1
	  ringing, but otherwise, there is no timeout.

	  message, you are supposed to take the low 16 bits of the integer
	  part, and the high 16 bits of the fractional part. However, the
	  code here was erroneously taking the low 16 bits of the
	  fractional part. It then shifted the result 16 bits down, so the
	  result was always zero. This fix makes it grab the appropriate
	  high 16 bits, instead. (issue #8991, pointed out by
	  andre_abrantes)

	  8711, there still may be an issue. If there is a second action
	  requested before the processing of the first action is finished,

	  channels/chan_iax2.c: Merge the changes from the
	  /team/group/vldtmf_fixup branch. The main bug being addressed
	  here is a problem introduced when two SIP channels using SIP INFO
	  dtmf have their media directly bridged. So, when a DTMF END frame
	  comes into Asterisk from an incoming INFO message, Asterisk would
	  try to emulate a digit of some length by first sending a DTMF
	  BEGIN frame and sending a DTMF END later timed off of incoming
	  audio. However, since there was no audio coming in, the DTMF_END
	  was never generated. This caused DTMF based features to no longer
	  work. To fix this, the core now knows when a channel doesn't care
	  about DTMF BEGIN frames (such as a SIP channel sending INFO
	  dtmf). If this is the case, then Asterisk will not emulate a
	  digit of some length, and will instead just pass through the
	  single DTMF END event. Channel drivers also now get passed the
	  length of the digit to their digit_end callback. This improves
	  SIP INFO support even further by enabling us to put the real
	  digit duration in the INFO message instead of a hard coded 250ms.
	  Also, for an incoming INFO message, the duration is read from the
	  frame and passed into the core instead of just getting ignored.

	* funcs/func_realtime.c: Fix the REALTIME() dialplan function.
	  ast_build_string() advances the string pointer to the position to
	  begin the next write into the buffer. So, this pointer can not be
	  used to copy the contents of the string later. The beginning of
	  the buffer must be saved. Interestingly enough, this code could
	  not have ever worked. (Pointed out by Sebb on IRC, thanks!)

	  chan_vpb (and any other C++ modules) to build properly

2007-01-03 01:19 +0000 [r49259]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Check pvt structure presence before passing
	  to send_command. This gets rid of the irritating message about a
	  packet without pvt structure. This happens because the scheduled
	  item is getting cancelled at almost the exact moment it is
	  getting executed.

2007-01-02 22:30 +0000 [r49237]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* main/ast_expr2.fl, main/ast_expr2f.c, pbx/ael/ael_lex.c,
	  pbx/ael/ael.flex: This is a slight modification to Josh's edits
	  for #8579; both files edited were the produced by flex; so the
	  source files need to be changed instead, and the generated files
	  regenerated.

2007-01-01 23:34 +0000 [r49098-49102]  Kevin P. Fleming <kpfleming@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_zap.c, build_tools/menuselect-deps.in, configure,
	  configure.ac, codecs/codec_zap.c: check specifically for VLDTMF
	  and transcoding support in the system's Zaptel installation, and
	  make only the modules that need those features dependent on them
	  (this will allow building the other Zaptel-using parts of
	  Asterisk against older versions of Zaptel or those on other
	  platforms that haven't caught up yet to the Linux version)

	* Makefile: use a simpler (and portable) method to ensure that
	  menuselect is built as a host binary

	* Makefile: revert this change until a better solution can be
	  found... 'env -i' was not being used properly, but even when
	  changed to do so, this process fails during cross-compilation
	  because the menuselect build still sees 'CC' as set to the
	  cross-compiler

	* pbx/pbx_config.c: IAX has been deprecated for quite some time so
	  we had better use IAX2 when creating the dial string for users.
	  (issue #8697 reported by ssokol)

	* channels/chan_zap.c: Use asprintf to build the channel names
	  instead of custom function. I believe the custom function is
	  doing some things that are not portable across all
	  implementations. (issue #8570 reported by hterag & issue #8692
	  reported by nicolasg)

	* main/rtp.c: If the Packet2Packet bridge is being broken because
	  of a masquerade then attempt to read a frame in so the masquerade
	  actually happens. Otherwise weirdness will occur. (issue #8696
	  reported by kjotte)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Initialize the packet queue in load_module
	  instead of just declaring the list with the default value. (issue
	  #8695 reported by ssokol)

2006-12-30 00:40 +0000 [r49061]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

2006-12-27 22:28 +0000 [r49009]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* main/ast_expr2f.c, pbx/ael/ael_lex.c: ast_copy_string is not

	  when we found a common option - Move uncommon (only global)
	  option away from handle_common_options Reported by rizzo. Thanks!

	* codecs/lpc10/Makefile, main/Makefile, codecs/gsm/Makefile,

	  utils/ael_main.c: remove some now-unnecessary explicit includes
	  of autoconfig.h clean up per-file dependencies during 'make
	  clean'

	* build_tools/prep_tarball: need an additional argument here to
	  make the downloads actually occur

	* configure, include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac,
	  acinclude.m4: use m4 quoting for AC_MSG_NOTICE calls, to keep
	  these calls from thinking they have multiple arguments

	* codecs/ilbc, formats, utils/Makefile, agi/Makefile, Makefile,

	  simplify dependency tracking system, using the compiler's
	  built-in method for generating them, and only doing dependency
	  tracking if developer mode is enabled via the configure script

	* Makefile, include/asterisk.h, main/stdtime/localtime.c: since we
	  really, really have to have autoconfig.h included before all
	  other headers (especially system headers), the Makefile will now
	  force it to happen (this will fix build problems with files like
	  ast_expr2f.c, where we can't control the inclusion order in the
	  file itself)

	* funcs/func_curl.c: instead of initializing the curl library every
	  time the CURL() function is invoked, do it only once per thread
	  (this allows multiple calls to CURL() in the dialplan for a
	  channel to run much more quickly, and also to re-use connections
	  to the server) (thanks to JerJer for frequently complaining about
	  this performance problem)

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Use a wakeup variable so that we don't wait
	  on IO indefinitely if packets need to be retransmitted.

	* main/rtp.c, include/asterisk/rtp.h: Payload values on the RTP
	  structure can change AFTER a bridge has started. This comes from
	  the packet handling of the SIP response when indication that it
	  was answered has been sent. Therefore we need to protect this
	  data with a lock when we read/write. (issue #8232 reported by
	  tgrman)

	* main/rtp.c: Remove direct RTCP bridging. I've come to the
	  conclusion that we should handle this through the core and not

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Restoring the old logic, since working
	  around it and fixing it seemed too complicated. - The

	  in the dialog. - The initreq stores the last request in the

	* main/translate.c: - If the source has no audio or no video

	  run through the audio and video loops if there is no audio or
	  video portion of the source If 0 is passed to powerof, it will
	  return -1. This value of -1 was then being used as an array index
	  in these loops, which caused a crash on some systems. Other than
	  this issue, this code works as we expected it to. If a format is
	  not in the source, and we have to translation path to it, it is
	  not offered in the list of acceptable destination formats. (fixes
	  issue #8231)

	  dialog in Asterisk's implementation (voicemail) even though we
	  don't support the server side of it. In this case, the standard
	  is a side issue ;-) - Added extened functionality for unsupported
	  methods (PING, PUBLISH) so we don't create PVT's for those
	  either. Russellb needs to judge what to do with this in 1.2, but
	  I think the current implementation n 1.2 is a bug since we're

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: fixed segfault which happens during
	  hold/transfer action

	* channels/chan_misdn.c: if INFORMATION Message come with keypad
	  instead of called party number, we just use the keypad as called
	  party number.

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c, channels/misdn_config.c,
	  channels/misdn/isdn_lib.h, channels/chan_misdn.c,

	  added the option 'reject_cause' to make it possible to set
	  the RELEASE_COMPLETE - cause on the 3. incoming PMP channel,
	  which is automatically rejected because chan_misdn does not
	  support that kind of callwaiting. Therefore chan_misdn supports
	  now 3 incoming channels on a PMP BRI Port. misdn_lib_get_free_bc
	  now gets the info if the requested channel is incoming or
	  outgoing to make the 3. channel possible

	* channels/misdn/isdn_lib.c, channels/misdn/isdn_lib.h,

	* CHANGES: I put the accumulated changes from the commit logs and
	  inspection, into CHANGES. Hope everyone approves!

	* configs/muted.conf.sample, utils/muted.c: Hang on a minute, the
	  install process sticks muted.conf in /etc/asterisk, so that's
	  where muted should look for it, right?

2006-10-05 02:40 +0000 [r44450]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

2006-10-04 17:04 +0000 [r44337-44365]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

2006-10-02 20:11 +0000 [r44199-44215]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Change the fd on the I/O context in case it
	  changed during the reload, which is indeed possible. (issue #7943
	  reported by eclubb)

2006-10-01 18:30 +0000 [r44111-44125]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* Makefile: Fix a problem that cuased AST_DATA_DIR in defaults.h to
	  be empty. The cause is that since ASTDATADIR is explicitly
	  exported using "export ASTDATADIR" at the top of the Makefile,
	  make no longer considers the variable "undefined", so the
	  Makefile can't use ?= to set ASTDATADIR if not yet set. (issue
	  #8063, reported by akohlsmith, fixed by me)

	* configs/queues.conf.sample: Fix the name of the "eventmemberstatus"
	  option in the sample queues.conf (issue #8065, adamg)

2006-10-01 15:01 +0000 [r44109]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

2006-09-30 16:28 +0000 [r44080]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* codecs/lpc10/Makefile, Makefile, main/Makefile: fix two recent
	  build problems: - with AST_DEVMODE, building codecs/lpc10 fails
	  because of lots of warnings, and the configure step in editline
	  fails as well. Fix this by removing the -Werror in these steps. -
	  on FreeBSD (but probably on other platforms as well), the final
	  link of asterisk fails because AST_LIBS was not exported to the
	  subdirs Makefiles. Add a proper fix in the top-level Makefile (a
	  possible alternative way is to add "export AST_LIBS" near the
	  beginning of the file). With this fix, i believe that some of the
	  platform-specific conditionals in main/Makefile are redundant
	  (because they should be already dealt with in the top level
	  Makefile) but i don't have a platform to check. Merging to head
	  will happen in a moment.

	  on RINGING message too, so when we send 200 OK message, we get
	  unidentified ACK message (because INVITE acknowledged on RINGING
	  message already), so 200 OK retransmits within its retransmission

	* main/channel.c,res/res_features.c: Fix a problem that occurred if
	  a user entered a digit
	  that matched a bridge feature that was configured using multiple
	  digits, and the digit that was pressed timed out in the feature
	  digit timeout period. For example, if blind transfer is
	  configured as '##', and a user presses just '#'. In this
	  situation, the call would lock up and no longer pass any frames.
	  (issue #7977 reported by festr, and issue #7982 reported by
	  michaels and valuable input provided by mneuhauser and kuj. Fixed
	  by me, with testing help and peer review from Joshua Colp). There
	  are a couple of issues involved in this fix: 1) When
	  ast_generic_bridge determines that there has been a timeout, it
	  returned AST_BRIDGE_RETRY. Then, when ast_channel_bridge gets
	  this result, it calls ast_generic_bridge over again with the same
	  timestamp for the next event. This results in an endless loop of
	  nothing until the call is terminated. This is resolved by simply
	  changing ast_generic_bridge to return AST_BRIDGE_COMPLETE when it
	  sees a timeout. 2) I also changed ast_channel_bridge such that if
	  in the process of calculating the time until the next event, it
	  knows a timeout has already occured, to immediately return
	  AST_BRIDGE_COMPLETE instead of attempting to bridge the channels
	  anyway. 3) In the process of testing the previous two changes, I
	  ran into a problem in res_features where ast_channel_bridge would
	  return because it determined that there was a timeout. However,
	  ast_bridge_call in res_features would then determine by its own
	  calculation that there was still 1 ms before the timeout really
	  occurs. It would then proceed, and since the bridge broke out and
	  did *not* return a frame, it interpreted this as the call was
	  over and hung up the channels. The reason for this was because
	  ast_bridge_call in res_features and ast_channel_bridge in
	  channel.c were using different times for their calculations.
	  channel.c uses the start_time on the bridge config, which is the
	  time that the feature digit was recieved. However, res_features
	  had another time, 'start', which was set right before calling
	  ast_channel_bridge. 'start' will always be slightly after
	  start_time in the bridge config, and sometimes enough to round up
	  to one ms. This is fixed by making ast_bridge_call use the same
	  time as ast_channel_bridge for the timeout calculation. ........

	  in passing. Originally, I did not commit this to 1.4 since it is
	  not necessarily fixing a bug. However, since the IMAP storage
	  code is brand new, I decided it would be better to make the
	  change here as well, in case someone has to work on this code to

	* configs/extensions.ael.sample: This change to extensions.ael was

	  direct conversion of the original extensions.conf, the macro and
